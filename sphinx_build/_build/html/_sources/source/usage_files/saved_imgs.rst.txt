Saved Images and Results of a Run
=================================

This section provides an overview of the saved images and results generated from a run. These visuals and metrics help in analyzing the performance of the models across different folds and configurations.

Model-Specific Results
----------------------
For each model, results are saved across all folds, allowing for detailed analysis of its performance. Below is an example of such a detailed result set for a single model.

Final Aggregated Results
------------------------
The final results aggregate the performance of all models, providing a comprehensive overview that averages the outcomes across all folds.

Boxplots for Performance Comparison
-----------------------------------
Boxplots are an effective way to visualize the variability in model performance. The results can be grouped either by fold or by model to provide different insights:

* **By Fold:** This grouping highlights the performance variability across different folds, helping to understand how each fold impacts the model's performance.

* **By Model:** This grouping allows for comparing the performance of different models, giving insights into which model performs best on average across folds.

ROC Curves
----------
ROC (Receiver Operating Characteristic) curves are particularly useful in evaluating models in multi-class or multi-label classification tasks. They illustrate the trade-off between the true positive rate and false positive rate across different thresholds.
