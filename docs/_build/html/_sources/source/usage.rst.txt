1. **`balance_management`**
   - **Purpose**: Handles data balancing techniques for imbalanced datasets.
   - **Key Features**: 
     - Supports oversampling (e.g., Random Oversampling, SMOTE) and undersampling.
     - Ensures models perform well across all classes.
   - **Adaptability**: Easily switch between different balancing strategies.

2. **`dataset_load`**
   - **Purpose**: Manages the loading and preprocessing of datasets.
   - **Key Features**:
     - Supports various data formats.
     - Handles initial data preparation: reading, transforming, and formatting.
   - **Adaptability**: Extendable to new data sources, standardizes dataset preparation.

3. **`figures`**
   - **Purpose**: Focuses on result visualization.
   - **Key Features**:
     - Generates customizable plots (e.g., boxplots, ROC curves).
     - Facilitates performance analysis of models.
   - **Adaptability**: Save plots in a specified directory for further analysis and facilitates the addition of new plots.

4. **`fold_management`**
   - **Purpose**: Manages data splitting for training and testing using cross-validation strategies.
   - **Key Features**:
     - Supports K-Fold cross-validation, simple splits, and metadata-based combinations.
     - Ensures robust and systematic model evaluation.
   - **Adaptability**: Flexible to different data structures and experimental needs.

5. **`label_management`**
   - **Purpose**: Generates labels based on user-defined conditions.
   - **Key Features**:
     - Supports binary and multi-class labeling.
     - Integrates label encoding for model compatibility.
   - **Adaptability**: Easily adjustable to various datasets and experimental goals.
